# school-students
This is a Python based project using the sqlite database to create a database containing details of school students. Being an user you can choose to add, update, view, delete from the master database. This is my first project on GitHub!

The source code contain 4 files in all, including one 'feedback.json' which is responsible to store all the feedback given by this project users, which promts itself ahead of pressing Quit. Rest are 'main.py' which is the main project as the name suggests, 'database.py' is the API which is imported by main.py to give it to users to interact easily, and 'contxtmgr.py' which is a general purpose context manager for SQLite databases and also JSON files.

I guess, we're stuck with some bugs in 'contxtmgr.py' as that's totally a new concept for me, and until we fix the bugs lets colaborate with working on branches and later I'll merge all our pull requests and see how it works. Looking forward to pro-active coding!
